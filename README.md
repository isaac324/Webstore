# Webstore-cst438
This application was made in 2019 for my CST 438 Software Engineering class.  
The application is a webstore application using angular code. 

# Features:
The application includes the following pages:
1) Sigin page  
2) Home page with navigation bar  
3) Cart section that includes all purchases users have added 
4) Checkout page 
5) Finalize page once purchases are completed 

Application is for display and demonstration purposes only so cart and sigin functions are not connected to any active
database.
